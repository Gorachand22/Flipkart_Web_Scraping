This web scraping is only applicable on the Flipkart website, where inside a box you input your product name and it will scrap all the results and store them in the Excel file.
Before using it first install the necessary libraries that are present inside the requirements.txt 
Again it is a very basic optimization not done yet, that's why it takes time to scrap and also depends upon your internal processor 
If you found any bugs kindly reach out to me
